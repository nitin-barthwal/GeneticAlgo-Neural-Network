# GeneticAlgo-Neural-Network
In this project I have implemented the Genetic Algorithm in Python .
The project involves a series of steps including ,
Normalization of data,
binarization, 
Crossover,
Mutation and 
Debinarization. 


The data set has been randomly divided into test data and training data. 

At the end I have also plotted a 3d scatter plot along with finding Overall Error .
